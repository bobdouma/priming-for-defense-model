This release is associated with the paper "When does it pay-off to prime for defense? A model analysis" published in New Phytologist
by Bob Douma, Peter Vermeulen, Erik Poelman, Marcel Dicke and Niels Anten

For details about the aim of the model, its rationale, and its specification we refer to the paper and its appendices. The script below is commented and runs with the files available in R. However, you may need assistance with interpreting the output and with changing some parts of the model.

The model can be freely used but comes with absolutely no warranty, nor are we responsible for any conclusions that result from the model (apart from those published in the above mentioned paper).

Please contact Bob Douma (bob.douma@wur.nl) for further queries
